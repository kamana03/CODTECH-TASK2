OVERVIEW OF THE PROJECT
# CODTECH-TASK2
Building a sandbox environment for analyzing malware samples in a controlled setting involves creating a system where malware can execute without harming the underlying host system or network. This involves several key components:

Isolation of the Environment: Ensure the malware cannot escape the sandbox and affect the host system or network.
Execution and Monitoring: Safely execute the malware and monitor its behavior, such as file system changes, network activity, registry modifications, and system resource consumption.
Analysis Tools: Collect data on the behavior of the malware and allow detailed forensic analysis afterward.
Wireshark: Captures network traffic.
Regshot: Compares registry snapshots before and after malware execution to identify changes.

Key Features to Implement
Execution Isolation:
Ensure malware cannot reach the host machine or other machines on the network. This can be achieved by using:

Firewalls: Block any outgoing or incoming connections from the VM.
Network Segmentation: Isolate the VM from the rest of the network using VLANs or internal network configurations.
Snapshot Reversion: Revert to a clean snapshot after each test to avoid contamination.
Monitoring & Logging:

Process Creation/Termination Monitoring: Capture process creation/termination and identify processes initiated by malware (e.g., using Procmon).
File System Activity Monitoring: Track file writes, deletions, and modifications to sensitive files or directories.
Registry Monitoring: Watch for unusual registry key creation or modification (important for Windows malware).
Network Activity: Monitor all inbound and outbound network traffic to see if the malware attempts to connect to malicious servers or make unauthorized connections.
Automated Malware Execution:

Implement a job scheduling system (like cron jobs or Windows Task Scheduler) to automatically execute malware samples within the sandbox.
Use scripts to start malware execution, monitor behavior, and capture logs at specified intervals.
Data Collection:

Collect data on file creation, modified registry keys, network traffic, and system resource usage (CPU, memory).
Logs should be stored in a central location for later analysis. You could use log management tools like ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) or Splunk for efficient log aggregation and analysis.
Reporting:

After analysis, generate automated reports that summarize findings, including process behavior, file changes, registry modifications, and network activity.
Use tools like Cuckoo Sandbox or custom Python scripts to generate and format detailed analysis reports.
5. Network Traffic Simulation
Simulate network services like HTTP, DNS, SMTP, and others using tools like Fakenet-NG to provide the malware with the necessary network interaction it might attempt to reach out to during execution.
This prevents the malware from contacting real-world servers, which could alert external parties or allow the malware to update itself.
